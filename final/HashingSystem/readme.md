explains how to use in usage error statement

you should run RBAHashAlgorithm.py first, then RBATestHashedCsv.py, then compare_hashes.py

Some notes:
- the XOR hash takes quite a while for me (like 15 - 20 seconds). Someone could have a look at this if they have time.
- many times, changing the files contents still produces the same hash. This might be an easy fix, I didn't have time to
  look into it yet.
