When transmitting data or storing them in a file, the data are required to be byte strings, 
but complex objects are seldom in this format. Serialization can convert these complex objects 
into byte strings for such use. After the byte strings are transmitted, the receiver will have 
to recover the original object from the byte string. This is known as deserialization.
