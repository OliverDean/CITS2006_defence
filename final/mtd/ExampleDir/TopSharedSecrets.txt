[Verse 1: Keno Carter]
I know I fucked up
Yes, I did (I did, I did)
Shit has been feelin' rough since she left me alone (She left me all alone)
Oh baby, where'd you go? (Oh baby, where'd you go?)
I lost my self control (I lost my self control)
And it's all because of you my dear (My dear)
I look at myself in the mirror (In the mirror)
Was I ever the man you wanted?

[Chorus: Keno Carter]
Spinnin' around, thinking of you
Oh, how'd we get here?
I got no clue
(I got no clue)

[Verse 2: ay3demi]
You are the wrong person I'm with
It'll take you a while and I've wasted my time
Just know when I'm gone, please don't shed a tear
Ain't no worries, no fear
'Cause I'll never be here
I've been thinkin' of you
Had me stuck in a loop
Everytime you fall, I'ma fall with you
It's just that I don't want you to be alone
And why you actin' brand new?
Thinkin' it was never gonna be like this
If I went away, would you come back?
Saying so I'd love, but I've never had it before

[Chorus: Keno Carter]
Spinnin' around, thinking of you
Oh, how'd we get here?
I got no clue

Now I beg that you
Bring someone brand new
Cause baby I'm tired of people like you
